# Stage change/reasoning scope and burden indicators

Repository-observable counts only. No token count, elapsed human time, or cognitive-load inference is made.

## Stage 3 — HD-010 resolution attempt (unadopted)

### Before/at implementation

- Target activities: direct/sourced Order creation, manager approval/rejection, Sales confirmation.
- Supplied rules: complete active Stage 1–3 rules in `worker-inputs/stage3-current-accepted-rules-v2.md`.
- Relevant data: `customer_order` (including `created_by`, status, total), `order_approval`, source quotation/order-line snapshot data.
- DDL: amended once before implementation (`DDL_AMENDMENT_002.md`).
- Source changed: one file, `src/app.js`; no structural move.

### After cross-activity review

- Activities actually implicated: sourced conversion, direct Order creation, approval decision, confirmation; quotation-line numeric inputs inform total representability.
- Rules actually implicated: sourced snapshot initial state, approval threshold, creator/manager separation, line numeric domain.
- Tables/data actually implicated: `customer_order.status`, `customer_order.total_amount`, `customer_order.created_by`, `order_approval.manager_id`, order/quotation line numeric columns.
- Unrelated business areas not implicated by findings: inventory reservation, shipment, cancellation/release activities.
- Human Decisions requested: 2 (HB-S3-02, HB-S3-03).
- Implementation defects: 3, recorded in `BLOCKERS.md`.
- Minimal business evidence sets are recorded with each finding in `BLOCKERS.md`.

### Burden indicators

| indicator | count / value |
| --- | --- |
| implementation runs | 1 fresh resolution run |
| rejected runs | 0 in this resolution attempt |
| aborted runs | 0 |
| consistency-review runs | 1 fresh Sol review |
| refactoring runs | 0 (blocked) |
| HUMAN_BLOCKER count | 2 |
| Human Decision count at stop | 0 new decisions after HD-010 |
| active Business Rules | 10 described in Stage 3 self-contained input |
| affected activities | 5 review-implicated |
| affected tables/data areas | 5 primary areas |
| changed source files | 1 |
| structural moves | 0 |
| DDL amendments in stage | 1 (pre-implementation) |
| acceptance amendments in stage | 1 new cumulative Stage 3 instrument |

### Stage 3 completion update

- Additional implementation/defect-resolution runs after HD-010: 3; fresh Sol reviews after resolution: 3; refactoring runs: 1.
- Final HUMAN_BLOCKER count after HD-011/HD-012: 0.
- Additional DDL amendment: DDL Amendment 003; additional acceptance amendments: 002, 003, 004.
- Final structure change: internal colocation only; no physical move.

## Stage 4 — factual completion record

- Target activities: Sales approved-Order revision, manager reapproval/rejection, Sales confirmation.
- Implicated rules/data: approval invalidation/threshold/confirmation; `customer_order`, `order_line`, `order_approval`, source quotation association.
- Runs: one implementation, one fresh Sol review, two fresh defect-resolution runs, one fresh re-review, one refactoring; no rejected/aborted run recorded.
- Human blockers/decisions: HB-S4-01 (explicitly cued) resolved by HD-013; one decision.
- DDL amendments: none. Acceptance amendments: 005 and 006. Changed source files per run: one `src/app.js`; physical moves: none.

## Stage 5 — factual completion record

- Target activities: Sales confirmation, reservation request, trusted asynchronous inventory result.
- Implicated rules/data: confirmation postcondition, result authority, requested/reserved/failed transitions, commercial/inventory independence; `customer_order`, `inventory_reservation`.
- Runs: one implementation, one fresh Sol review, one refactoring; no rejected/aborted run recorded.
- Human blockers/decisions: HB-S5-01 resolved by HD-014; one decision. The observer-only provenance is decomposed in `FINDING_PROVENANCE.md`.
- DDL amendments: none. Acceptance amendments: 007. Changed source files per run: one `src/app.js`; structural move: reservation behavior extracted into an in-file `InventoryReservationStore`, not a physical module move.

## Stage 6 — factual in-progress record

- Target activities: Sales cancellation, trusted inventory reservation result, trusted release completion.
- Implicated data: `customer_order.status`, `customer_order.shipment_at`, `inventory_reservation.order_id/status`; current DDL was assessed sufficient under HD-015/016 and no DDL amendment was made.
- Human blocker/decisions: HB-S6-01 was decomposed observer-only in `FINDING_PROVENANCE.md`; HD-015 and HD-016 supplied cancellation/release semantics. External progress conditions are recorded as environment/verification assumptions, not Business Rules.
- Runs to current evidence: one fresh Terra implementation; two fresh Sol reviews; fresh v2 and v3 verification runs; v3/v4 acceptance-instrument amendments correct measurement defects. No source implementation defect or new HUMAN_BLOCKER was reported by either Sol review.
- Acceptance amendments: 008 (initial Stage 6), 009 (terminal paths), 010 (release authority), 011 (cancellation eligibility). v4 verification/adoption/refactoring remain pending.
- Changed source files in candidate: `src/app.js`. Structural moves: none; source remains one file. The independent inventory authority is a test-only fake and is not production DDL.
